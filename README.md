# AIExampleProject

Example project that demos some of my AI code in Unity.
Due to conflicts when moving code around, the project shown is a slightly simplified version of the code I currently use. 

Main Systems:

Behavior Tree
  The core of all my AI. A well-known architecture that greatly increases code reusability, modularity, composability, and debuggability.

Behavior Tree Editor
  A custom editor used to create and edit behavior trees. 

Horde Manager
  System used to track and manage large amounts of AI. Uses spatial partitioning to optimize off-screen AI.

Sensing
  A set of several sub-systems that work together to give AI the ability to respond to their environment.

Command Prompt
  An easily reusable bit of code that mimics a command prompt interface. One of my biggest debugging tools.
